The ultimate goal of this project is to create a roguelite MUD that you can play with your friends!  Right now it is only in the development stages.  Once the base roguelite is done, future goals include:

--> Multiplayer via LAN
--> Chat
--> Accounts that save progress
--> Leveling system
--> Events
--> Multiple Dungeons
--> And more!
